Wholesale real estate has increasingly piqued the interest of many in recent times as a captivating alternative investment strategy and a means to generate passive income. At its core, wholesaling is about playing the role of a middleman, bridging the gap between motivated sellers and eager buyers, and earning a profit without directly investing in the property.\
\
Here’s a relatable illustration: Let’s say that you go to Alaba Market in a bid to buy an electrical appliance. But before you walk into a store, someone grabs you by the hand and asks you to come to their shop. You follow them, but the first shop you go to does not have the appliance. Then they take you to their "second shop", and maybe you're unable to find the appliance there too. Finally, they take you to their "other shop", where you are eventually able to buy the appliance. From experience, we know know that those who usually claim “second shops” have little or no affiliation to those stores. Wholesaling in real estate is strikingly similar—it's like being a matchmaker, connecting sellers with buyers and reaping a small reward for your efforts.\
\
In wholesaling, you do not need to actually own or buy the property. The primary role of a wholesaler is to connect motivated sellers with eager buyers. The wholesaler identifies properties being sold below market value and secures them with a purchase agreement. This agreement typically includes an assignment clause, allowing the wholesaler to assign the contract to another buyer. Once the wholesaler finds a suitable buyer, they assign the purchase agreement to them, charging an assignment fee for their efforts. The buyer then closes on the property, and the wholesaler walks away with a profit without ever having to buy the property themselves. The whole process can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the specific deal and market conditions.\
\
Historically, wholesaling has been an important part of the real estate industry. It has allowed individuals with little capital to break into the market and make a profit without having to buy, renovate, or manage the property themselves. In the early days, wholesalers primarily dealt with properties that were being sold due to the owner's financial troubles, such as foreclosure or bankruptcy. Over time, wholesalers began to target properties in need of repairs or other issues that made them less desirable to traditional buyers. These days, many people are drawn to wholesaling as a means of generating income without the heavy financial burden of owning real estate.\
\
The wholesale real estate process can be broken down into a few essential steps:\
-Identify a property being sold below market value\
-Secure the property with a purchase agreement\
-Search for an investor or cash buyer interested in purchasing the property\
-Assign the purchase agreement to the buyer, charging an assignment fee\
