## ![🆚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/svg/1f19a.svg) Dissertation vs. Thesis: Is There a Difference?

People often consider a thesis and a dissertation to be the same thing. Yet, there is an important distinction between them. The key difference is that you need a thesis to complete a master’s degree, while a dissertation is necessary for obtaining a doctorate. Keep in mind that it’s vice versa in European higher education.

Here are some other differences:

|                 | Thesis                                                                      | Dissertation                                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Length**      | A thesis is usually shorter than a dissertation at approximately 100 pages. | A dissertation is usually 200-300 pages long.                        |
| **Originality** | In a thesis, you build your work on an already existing idea.               | In a dissertation, you need to present entirely original hypothesis. |
| **Research**    | A thesis involves preliminary research.                                     | A dissertation requires deeper original research.                    |

Despite these differences, theses and dissertations have a lot in common:

* You need them to complete a degree.
* Both require certain levels of expertise and writing skills.
* You defend an argument in both of them.
* Plagiarism is prohibited in both theses and dissertations.
